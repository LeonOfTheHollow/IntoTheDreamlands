* Implement Effects:
	* Check for Effects when calculating dice pool and on phase transitions
		* Best way to implement Opulence?
* Implement BP -> instinct card relationship: shouldn't list deck explicitly
* scale resolution with intention, probably pillarboxes
* Implement "Duel Piece" high level parent to encompass all body parts, cards,
gadgets, and effects.
	1. Define passthrough interface for intweractions at each game transition
	2. Override as necessary with any "on x step" effects
	3. Call these all at once in the DM by just calling the passthrough on every
	Duel Piece. Should save the trouble of having bespoke calls to different types
	in the DM at every state transition.
