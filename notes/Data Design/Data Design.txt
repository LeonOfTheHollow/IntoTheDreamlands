Saving and Loading

The player can use the "Save" command at any time, but the interface will note
that you can only save your progress from the "beginning of the current dream".

Practically, there are three "stores" or layers of memory:
	* The entire state of the rooms and instances in the current runtime.
	* The flat "global" data registry.
	* The .ini external save file.
	
The basic idea is that the Save and Load functions are glue code that
mirrors the contents of the global registry and the .ini file 1:1.
So the contents of the global registry is the "last saved" data.

We keep things like lists of unlocks, story flags, and other "game progress"
on global. We keep more transient data like inventory and health on the relevant
entities instead, usually obj_player, and we write them to global between rooms.

We mirror global to the .ini when we want to save, and we load the .ini into global when
we load. 

Maybe we don't really need to use global for save buffering and should just 

Room Persistence

By default, rooms are not persistent: returning to a room on a different night,
or even by circling back through the web,  will result in a fresh iteration of the room
(rerunning its room creation code).
The exception is whichever room the player currently occupies, which IS persistent: this
is necessary to maintain state when switching to and from the Duel room.
Rabbitholes and the Wakeup scene handle un-persisting a room which is being departed.
Room creation code handles setting a room to persist
