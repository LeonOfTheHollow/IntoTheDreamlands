CURTAIN:
Epigraph
	"I stand amid the roar
	Of a surf-tormented shore,
	And I hold within my hand
	Grains of the golden sand —

	How few! yet how they creep
	Through my fingers to the deep,
	While I weep — while I weep!
	
	O God! Can I not grasp
	Them with a tighter clasp?
	O God! can I not save
	One from the pitiless wave?
	
	Is all that we see or seem
	But a dream within a dream?"
