BARD output

Yes, that makes sense. I think it's a really interesting system, and I can see how it would be a lot of fun to play. I like the idea that players have some control over what attacks they use, but that they also have to rely on luck and chance. It adds a lot of tension and excitement to the game.

Here are some alternate drafts for the themes of the three different statistics:

* **Dream-Power:** This could represent the power of the dream-form, or the amount of damage it can deal. The dream-power could be themed as things like:
    * **Reality-Warping:** The dream-form has the power to bend reality to its will, allowing it to deal massive damage.
    * **Time-Distortion:** The dream-form can distort time, allowing it to deal multiple attacks in a single turn.
    * **Space-Warping:** The dream-form can warp space, allowing it to teleport around the battlefield and deal attacks from unexpected angles.
* **Dream-Speed:** This could represent the speed of the dream-form, or how quickly it can move. The dream-speed could be themed as things like:
    * **Flight:** The dream-form can fly, allowing it to move around the battlefield quickly and easily.
    * **Telekinesis:** The dream-form can control objects with its mind, allowing it to move them around quickly.
    * **Super-Speed:** The dream-form is incredibly fast, allowing it to move around the battlefield at superhuman speeds.
* **Dream-Intelligence:** This could represent the intelligence of the dream-form, or how well it can think and plan. The dream-intelligence could be themed as things like:
    * **Psychic Powers:** The dream-form has psychic powers, allowing it to read minds, predict the future, and control the thoughts of others.
    * **Mastery of Strategy:** The dream-form is a master of strategy, allowing it to outwit its opponents and win battles.
    * **Sherlock Holmes-Level Deduction:** The dream-form is a master detective, allowing it to deduce the truth from even the smallest clues.
